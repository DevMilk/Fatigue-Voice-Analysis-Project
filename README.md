# Fatigue-Voice-Analysis
My 3 Months of Research and Project about Fatigue Voice Analysis using Transfer Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks. 

Approximately 3000 spectrogram images of voices gathered and converted and grouped to 4 types of spectrograms (MEL-scale, BARK-scale, ERB-scale, LOG-scale) using MATLAB, 4 types of labeling and 2 types of voices (Letter voices and Word voices) by my advisors on university were used to classify and analyse fatigueness of the 
the person to which the voice belongs.

MEL type spectrogram images were the highest success among all folders, with
%94.77 in test results on word folders that scored as 1 or 10. In addition, the
highest fold score achieved was obtained with MEL-type
spectrogram images with %100 .

BARK type spectrogram images with %84.17 in the test results on word
folders achieved the highest success among all folders that scored as 1, 2, 9 or 10, as
shown in the figures. In addition, the highest fold score
achieved was obtained with BARK type spectrogram images
with %93.84 .

MEL type spectrogram images were the highest success among all folders that scored as 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 or 10 with
%80.63 in test results on word folders. In addition, the
highest fold score achieved was obtained using LOG type
spectrogram images with %84.37 .
