# Fatigue-Voice-Analysis
My 3 Months of Research and Project about Fatigue Voice Analysis using Transfer Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks. 

Approximately 3000 spectrogram images of voices gathered and converted and grouped to 4 types of spectrograms (MEL-scale, BARK-scale, ERB-scale, LOG-scale) using MATLAB, 4 types of labeling and 2 types of voices (Letter voices and Word voices) by my advisors on university were used to classify and analyse fatigueness of the 
the person to which the voice belongs.
